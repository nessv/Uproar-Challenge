### Uproar challenge Project
**Time Limit:** 4 hours

**Objective:** Fetch a list of videos from an API, pull in a video and play it, ensuring the video navigation buttons are not displayed. The video should be played on a continuous loop.

#### Tasks
- Implement assignment using SwiftUI
- The user should be able to pick a video from a list and watch the selected video, at full screen, in the app.

Tapping the video should pause/play the video. Add a button on the video that navigates to a child view (using a navigation link). These views must share an environment object. The child view should have a back button to return.
##### The user should be able to:
- Tap on the video to pause and play it.
- Tap on the navigation button without pausing the video
